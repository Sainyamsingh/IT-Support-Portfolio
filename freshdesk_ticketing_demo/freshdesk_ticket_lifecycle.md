# Outcome
Completed a realistic ticket lifecycle in Freshdesk:
- Performed triage, assignment, and priority setting.
- Used internal notes for work-in-progress tracking and public replies for customer communication.
- Moved the ticket through Pending → Waiting on Customer → Resolved, and verified removal from the Unresolved queue.
This demonstrates practical helpdesk operations in a SaaS ticketing tool suitable for an entry-level IT support role.
