Objective
Resolve a user report that the office printer is not printing any documents and document the Freshdesk workflow from first response to resolution.

Steps
1) Open Freshdesk ticket #7 titled “Printer not responding” submitted by Sarah James (Advanced Machinery) via the portal.
2) Send troubleshooting reply to the requester:
   - “Please restart the printer and check that it’s set as the default printer on your computer. Also verify that there are no pending print jobs stuck in the queue — if there are, clear them and try printing again.”
3) Set ticket properties:
   - Type: Problem
   - Status: Waiting on Customer
   - Priority: Low
   - Agent: sainyam katoch
4) After the customer confirms success, update Status to Resolved.
