Objective
Resolve a user report that clicking a Microsoft Teams meeting link does nothing, and document the Freshdesk workflow from first response to resolution.

Steps
1) Open Freshdesk ticket #5 titled “Unable to join Teams meeting” submitted by Johnny Appleseed (Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA) via the portal.
2) Send troubleshooting reply to the requester:
   - “Please try opening the meeting link in either Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. Also make sure the Teams desktop app is installed and updated to the latest version. If you’re using the web version, allow pop-ups for the site and try again.”
3) Set ticket properties:
   - Type: Problem
   - Status: Waiting on Customer
   - Priority: Urgent
   - Agent: sainyam katoch
4) After the customer confirms success, update Status to Closed.
