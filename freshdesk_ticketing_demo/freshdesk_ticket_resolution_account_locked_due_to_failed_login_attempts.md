Objective
Resolve a user report that their account is locked due to too many failed login attempts and document the Freshdesk workflow from first response to resolution.

Steps
1) Open Freshdesk ticket #9 titled “Account Locked Due to Failed Login Attempts” submitted by Emily Dean (Global Learning Inc) via the portal.
2) Acknowledge and verify lock:
   - Reply: “Thanks. I’ve checked and your account is indeed locked due to multiple incorrect password attempts. I’ll go ahead and unlock it now.”
   - Set properties: Type → Incident, Priority → Medium, Status → Pending.
3) Unlock and offer reset:
   - Reply: “Your account is now unlocked. You can try logging in again. If you’ve forgotten your password, I recommend resetting it to avoid future lockouts. Would you like me to reset it now?”
   - Status → Waiting on Customer.
4) On customer consent (“Yes, please.”), send reset link:
   - Reply: “I’ve sent a password reset link to your registered email address. Please follow the instructions in that email to set a new password.”
5) After the customer confirms successful login (“Got it, and I can log in now. Thanks!”), send closure note and set Status → Resolved.
