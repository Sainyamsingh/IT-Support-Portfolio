Objective
Resolve a user report that the VPN disconnects every few minutes and document the Freshdesk workflow from first response to resolution.

Steps
1) Open Freshdesk ticket #6 titled “VPN connection drops frequently” submitted by Emily Dean (Global Learning Inc) via the portal.
2) Send troubleshooting reply to the requester:
   - “Please restart your router/modem and then reconnect to the VPN. You can also try connecting to a different VPN server location to see if it’s more stable. If possible, connect via a wired Ethernet cable for a stronger connection.”
3) Set ticket properties:
   - Type: Problem
   - Status: Waiting on Customer
   - Priority: High
   - Agent: sainyam katoch
4) After the customer confirms success, update Status to Closed.
