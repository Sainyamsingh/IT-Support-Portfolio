Objective
Resolve a user report that Outlook emails are not updating on a mobile device, and document the Freshdesk workflow from first response to resolution.

Steps
1) Open Freshdesk ticket #4 titled “Email not syncing on mobile device” submitted by Sarah James (Advanced Machinery) via the portal.
2) Send troubleshooting reply to the requester:
   - “Please try closing and reopening the Outlook app on your phone. Also ensure that your mobile data or Wi-Fi is working properly. If the issue persists, remove the email account from the app and re-add it. This should refresh the connection and allow your emails to sync again.”
3) Set ticket properties:
   - Type: Problem
   - Status: Waiting on Customer
   - Priority: Medium
   - Agent: sainyam katoch
4) After the customer confirms success, update Status to Resolved.
