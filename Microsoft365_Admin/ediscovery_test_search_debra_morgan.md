##  Outcome

- The search was created using the visual **Condition Builder**, which is why the result summary said: ‚ÄúQuery does not contain keywords‚Äù ‚Äî this is normal behavior.
- The search returned **2 matching emails** from **Debra Morgan's mailbox**, and **0** from Dexter Morgan, proving the filters were applied correctly.
- All necessary permissions were active and the search operation succeeded without error.
